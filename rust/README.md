# Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. 
It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

All of the official documentation is also available locally using the `rustup doc` command,
which will open up these resources for you in your browser without requiring a network connection!

## [The Rust Programming Language](trpl/README.md)

The official documentation is available locally using the `rustup doc --book` command.
Affectionately nicknamed **the book**, The Rust Programming Language will give you an overview of the language from first principles. 
You’ll build a few projects along the way, and by the end, you’ll have a solid grasp of how to use the language.
