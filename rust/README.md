# Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. 
It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

`rustup doc --help`

All of the official documentation is also available locally using the `rustup doc` command,
which will open up these resources for you in your browser without requiring a network connection!



## [The Rust Programming Language](trpl/README.md)

The official documentation is available locally using the `rustup doc --book` command.
Affectionately nicknamed **the book**, The Rust Programming Language will give you an overview of the language from first principles. 
You’ll build a few projects along the way, and by the end, you’ll have a solid grasp of how to use the language.


## [Rust By Example](rust-by-example/README.md)

The official documentation is available locally using the `rustup doc --rust-by-example` command.
If reading multiple hundreds of pages about a language isn’t your style, then **Rust By Example** has you covered. 
**RBE** shows off a bunch of code without using a lot of words. It also includes exercises!
