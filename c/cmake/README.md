## [archlinux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CMake_package_guidelines)

> Since CMake version `3.13`, there is a `-B` option that automatically creates the build directory \
> The `-S` option specifies the source directory (where to search for a `CMakeLists.txt` file) and avoids the need of `cd`'ing into the source tree before executing `cmake` \
> Combined together, these two options are a convenient way to specify the build and the source directories
