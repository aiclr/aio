//Note that unlike e.g. C,
//Go does not use an integer return value from main to indicate exit status.
//If youâ€™d like to exit with a non-zero status you should use os.Exit

// If you run exit.go using go run, the exit will be picked up by go and printed.
//go run exit.go

//1

//By building and executing a binary you can see the status in the terminal.
//go build exit.go
//./exit
// echo $?
// 3

//$? is the return code of the last executed command.
